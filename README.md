This library simulates a point spread function of a wide field optical microscope and creates a volumetric rendering using the VTK library. This is the first step in the development of deconvolution software for optical microscopes. Further details on what a point spread function is and how deconvolution is accomplished can be read in the file "poster sohail chatoor Bachelor Thesis.pdf"

To get started, run the python file runMe.py and study it's contents. This project does not do full deconvolution yet, but should be seen as a first step toward that goal. The current status of this project is that a point spread function is calculated and displayed.
